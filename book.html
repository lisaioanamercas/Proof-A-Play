        <blockquote>
            <p>“<em>Proof</em> surprises us with its aliveness . . . Mr. Auburn takes
            pleasure in knowledge ... At the same time, he is unshowily
            fresh and humane, and he has written a lovely play.”</p>

        <h2>Act I</h2>
        <h3>Scene 1</h3>

        <p class="stage-direction">Night. CATHERINE sits in a chair. She is exhausted, haphazardly dressed. Eyes closed. ROBERT is standing behind her. He is CATHERINE's father. Rumpled academic look. CATHERINE does not know he is there. After a moment:</p>

        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Can't sleep?</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Jesus, you scared me.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Sorry.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> What are you doing here?</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> I thought I'd check up on you. Why aren't you in bed?</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Your student is still here. He's up in your study.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> He can let himself out.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> I might as well wait up till he's done.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> He's not my student anymore. He's teaching now. Bright kid.</p>
        
        <p class="stage-direction">(Beat.)</p>
        
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> What time is it?</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> It's almost one.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Huh.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> After midnight . . .</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> So?</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> So: <span class="stage-direction">(He indicates something on the table behind him: a bottle of champagne.)</span> Happy birthday.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Dad.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Do I ever forget?</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Thank you.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Twenty-five. I can't believe it.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Neither can I. Should we have it now?</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> It's up to you.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Yes.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> You want me to open it?</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Let me. Last time you opened a bottle of champagne out here you broke a window.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> That was a long time ago. I resent your bringing it up.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> You're lucky you didn't lose an eye.</p>
        <p class="stage-direction">(Pop. The bottle foams.)</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Twenty-five!</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> I feel old.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> You're a kid.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Glasses?</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Goddamn it, I forgot the glasses. Do you want me to -</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Nah.</p>
        <p class="stage-direction">(CATHERINE drinks from the bottle. A long pull. ROBERT watches her.)</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> I hope you like it. I wasn't sure what to get you.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> This is the worst champagne I have ever tasted.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> I am proud to say I don't know anything about wines. I hate those kind of people who are always talking about "vintages."</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> It's not even champagne.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> The bottle was the right shape.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> "Great Lakes Vineyards." I didn't know they made wine in Wisconsin.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> A girl who's drinking from the bottle shouldn't complain. Don't guzzle it. It's an elegant beverage. Sip.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> <span class="stage-direction">(Offering the bottle)</span> Do you-</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> No, go ahead.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> You sure?</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Yeah. It's your birthday.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Happy birthday to me.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> What are you going to do on your birthday?</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Drink this. Have some.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> No. I hope you're not spending your birthday alone.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> I'm not alone.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> I don't count.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Why not?</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> I'm your old man. Go out with some friends.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Right.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Your friends aren't taking you out?</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> No.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Why not?</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Because in order for your friends to take you out you generally have to have friends.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> <span class="stage-direction">(Dismissive)</span> Oh-</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> It's funny how that works.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> You have friends. What about that cute blonde, what was her name?</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> What?</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> She lives over on Ellis Avenue— you used to spend every minute together.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Cindy Jacobsen?</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Cindy Jacobsen!</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> That was in third grade, Dad. Her family moved to Florida in 1983.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> What about Claire?</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> She's not my friend, she's my sister. And she's in New York. And I don't like her.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> I thought she was coming in.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Not till tomorrow.</p>
        <p class="stage-direction">(Beat.)</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> My advice, if you find yourself awake late at night, is to sit down and do some mathematics.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Oh please.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> We could do some together.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> No.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Why not?</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> I can't think of anything worse. You sure you don't want any?</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Yeah, thanks. You used to love it.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Not anymore.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> You knew what a prime number was before you could read.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Well now I've forgotten.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> <span class="stage-direction">(Hard)</span> Don't waste your talent, Catherine.</p>
        <p class="stage-direction">(Beat.)</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> I knew you'd say something like that.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> I realize you've had a difficult time.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Thanks.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> That's not an excuse. Don't be lazy.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> I haven't been lazy, I've been taking care of you.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Kid, I've seen you. You sleep till noon, you eat junk, you don't work, the dishes pile up in the sink. If you go out it's to buy magazines. You come back with a stack of magazines this high— I don't know how you read that crap. And those are the good days. Some days you don't get up, you don't get out of bed.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Those are the good days.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Bullshit. Those days are lost. You threw them away. And you'll never know what else you threw away with them—the work you lost, the ideas you didn't have, discoveries you never made because you were moping in your bed at four in the afternoon. <span class="stage-direction">(Beat.)</span> You know I'm right. <span class="stage-direction">(Beat.)</span></p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> I've lost a few days.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> How many?</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Oh, I don't know.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> I bet you do.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> What?</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> I bet you count.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Knock it off.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Well do you know or don't you?</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> I don't.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Of course you do. How many days have you lost?</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> A month. Around a month.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Exactly.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Goddamn it, I don't—</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> <em>How many?</em></p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Thirty-three days.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Exactly?</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> I don't know.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Be precise, for Chrissake.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> I slept till noon today.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Call it thirty-three and a quarter days.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Yes, all right.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> You're kidding!</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> No.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Amazing number!</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> It's a depressing fucking number.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Catherine, if every day you say you've lost were a year, it would be a very interesting fucking number.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Thirty-three and a quarter years is not interesting.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Stop it. You know exactly what I mean.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> <span class="stage-direction">(Conceding)</span> 1729 weeks.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> 1729. Great number. The smallest number expressible—</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> —expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> 12 cubed plus 1 cubed equals 1729.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> And 10 cubed plus 9 cubed. Yes, we've got it, thank you.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> You see? Even your depression is mathematical. Stop moping and get to work. The kind of potential you have—</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> I haven't done anything good.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> You're young. You've got time.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> I do?</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Yes.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> By the time you were my age you were famous.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> By the time I was your age I'd already done my best work.</p>
        <p class="stage-direction">(Beat.)</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> What about after?</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> After what?</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> After you got sick.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> What about it?</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> You couldn't work then.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> No, if anything I was sharper.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> <span class="stage-direction">(She can't help it: she laughs.)</span> Dad.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> I was. Hey, it's true. The clarity—that was the amazing thing. No doubts.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> You were happy?</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Yeah, I was busy.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Not the same thing.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> I don't see the difference. I knew what I wanted to do and I did it.<br>
        If I wanted to work a problem all day long, I did it.<br>
        If I wanted to look for information—secrets, complex and tantalizing messages—I could find them all around me. In the air. In a pile of fallen leaves some neighbor raked together. In box scores in the paper, written in the steam coming up off a cup of coffee. The whole world was talking to me.<br>
        If I just wanted to close my eyes, sit quietly on the porch and listen for the messages, I did that.<br>
        It was wonderful.</p>
        <p class="stage-direction">(Beat.)</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> How old were you? When it started.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Mid-twenties. Twenty-three, four. <span class="stage-direction">(Beat.)</span> Is that what you're worried about?</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> I've thought about it.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Just getting a year older means nothing, Catherine.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> It's not just getting older.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> It's me.</p>
        <p class="stage-direction">(Beat.)</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> I've thought about it.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Really?</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> How could I not?</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Well if that's why you're worried you're not keeping up with the medical literature. There are all kinds of factors. It's not simply something you inherit. Just because I went bughouse doesn't mean you will.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Dad . . .</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Listen to me. Life changes fast in your early twenties and it shakes you up. You're feeling down. It's been a bad week. You've had a lousy couple years, no one knows that better than me. But you're gonna be okay.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Yeah?</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Yes. I promise you. Push yourself. Don't read so many magazines. Sit down and get the machinery going and I swear to God you'll feel fine. The simple fact that we can talk about this together is a good sign.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> A good sign?</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Yes!</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> How could it be a good sign?</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Because! Crazy people don't sit around wondering if they're nuts.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> They don't?</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Of course not. They've got better things to do. Take it from me. A very good sign that you're crazy is an inability to ask the question "Am I crazy?"</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Even if the answer is yes?</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Crazy people don't ask. You see?</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Yes.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> So if you're asking . . .</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> I'm not.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> But if you were, it would be a very good sign.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> A good sign . . .</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> A good sign that you're fine.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Right.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> You see? You've just gotta think these things through. Now come on, what do you say? Let's call it a night; you go up, get some sleep, and then in the morning you can—</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Wait. No.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> What's the matter?</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> It doesn't work.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Why not?</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> It doesn't make sense.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Sure it does.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> No.</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> Where's the problem?</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> The problem is you are crazy!</p>
        <p><span class="character">ROBERT:</span> What difference does that make?</p>

        <p><span class="character">HAL:</span> I know you don't need anybody in your hair right now. Look, I spent the last couple days getting everything sorted out. It's mostly notebooks.

        <p><span class="character">HAL:</span> Yes, but he wrote them.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> He was a graphomaniac, Harold. Do you know what that is?</p>

        <p><span class="character">HAL:</span> Well, I'm gonna be late . . . Some friends of mine are in this band. They're playing at a bar up on Diversey. Way down the bill, they're probably going on around two, two-thirty. I said I'd be there.</p>
        <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Great.</p>
        <p><span class="character">HAL:</span> They're all in the math department. They're really good.</p>
    <p>They have this great song—you'd like it—called "i"—lower-case I. They just stand there and don't play anything for three minutes.</p>
    <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> "Imaginary Number."</p>
    <p><span class="character">HAL:</span> It's a math joke. You see why they're way down the bill.</p>
    <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Long drive to see some nerds in a band.</p>
    <p><span class="character">HAL:</span> God I hate when people say that. It is not that long a drive.</p>
    <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> So they are nerds.</p>
    <p><span class="character">HAL:</span> Oh they're raging geeks. But they're geeks who, you know, can dress themselves . . . hold down a job at a major university . . . Some of them have switched from glasses to contacts. They play sports, they play in a band, they get laid surprisingly often, so in that sense they sort of make you question the whole set of terms: geek, nerd, wonk, dweeb, dilbert, paste-eater.</p>
    <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> You're in this band, aren't you?</p>
    <p><span class="character">HAL:</span> Okay, yes. I play drums. You want to come? I never sing, I swear to God.</p>

    <p><span class="character">HAL:</span> Yeah, I have a full teaching load this quarter plus my own work.</p>
    <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Plus band practice.</p>
    <p><span class="character">HAL:</span> I don't have time to do this but I'm going to. If you'll let me. <span class="stage-direction">(Beat.)</span> I loved your dad. I don't believe a mind like his can just shut down. He had lucid moments. He had a lucid year, a whole year four years ago.</p>
    <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> It wasn't a year. It was more like nine months.</p>
    <p><span class="character">HAL:</span> A school year. He was advising students . . . I was stalled on my Ph.D. I was this close to quitting. I met with your dad and he put me on the right track with my research. I owe him.</p>
    <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Sorry.</p>
    <p><span class="character">HAL:</span> Look. Let me— You're twenty-five, right?</p>
    <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> How old are you?</p>
    <p><span class="character">HAL:</span> It doesn't matter. Listen.</p>
    <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Fuck you, how old are you?</p>
    <p><span class="character">HAL:</span> I'm twenty-eight, all right? When your dad was younger than both of us, he made major contributions to three fields: game theory, algebraic geometry, and nonlinear operator theory. Most of us never get our heads around one. He basically invented the mathematical techniques for studying rational behavior, and he gave the astrophysicists plenty to work over too. Okay?</p>
    <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Don't lecture me.</p>
    <p><span class="character">HAL:</span> I'm not. I'm telling you, if I came up with one-tenth of the shit your dad produced, I could write my own ticket to any math department in the country.

    <p><span class="character">HAL:</span> What? No! It would be under your dad's name. It would be for your dad.</p>

    <p class="stage-direction">I spent my life with him. I fed him. Talked to him. Tried to listen when he talked. Talked to people who weren't there . . . Watched him shuffling around like a ghost. A very smelly ghost. He was filthy. I had to make sure he bathed. My own father.</p>
    <p><span class="character">HAL:</span> I'm sorry. I shouldn't have . . .</p>
    <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> After my mother died it was just me here. I tried to keep him happy no matter what idiotic project he was doing. He used to read all day. He kept demanding more and more books. I took them out of the library by the carload. We had hundreds upstairs. Then I realized he wasn't reading: he believed aliens were sending him messages through the Dewey decimal numbers on the library books. He was trying to work out the code.</p>
    <p><span class="character">HAL:</span> What kind of messages?</p>
    <p><span class="character">CATHERINE:</span> Beautiful mathematics. The most elegant proofs, perfect proofs, proofs like music.</p>
